## Key Features

### Photo and Album Management
- Enabled users to create, edit, and delete albums.
- Allowed adding, removing, and organizing photos within albums.

### Tagging System
- Integrated a flexible tagging mechanism for users to add, edit, and search photos based on multiple tags.

### Serialization for Persistence
- Implemented data storage using Java serialization to ensure user data (photos, albums, tags) is saved and retrievable across sessions.

### Interactive UI
- Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using JavaFX.
- Included features like photo captioning and viewing metadata.

### File Handling
- Managed local files efficiently, associating them with application data for seamless access and modifications.
